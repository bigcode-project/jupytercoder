```

Open chrome://extensions/ in your browser and enable developer mode.

## Demo
```bash
cd examples
jupyter notebook
```

In case you encounter issue, you might want to install the same jupyter notebook version
```bash
jupyter notebook --version
>>> 6.5.2
```

Open the notebook sklearn_digits.ipynb and try it out.
Type ctrl+space to trigger the code completion when you are in a code cell, then ctrl to accept it (welcome your thought on the key binding!).
